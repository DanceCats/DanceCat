DanceCats is a simple data reporting tool which allowed user to get data and
have some basic overview on it.

DanceCats now support scheduling jobs that will query on MySQL, 
SQLServer and PostgreSQL. Once the jobs is done, results can be 
downloaded as desired format such as xlsx, csv, etc, which can 
also be received by email if set.
